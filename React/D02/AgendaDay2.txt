5- Dealing With Images
    you can put images inside:
	- Public Folder
		❌ Images are not included in the build process (no optimizations).
		❌ You must manually ensure files exist—no Webpack/Vite validation.
	- src Folder
		✅ Webpack/Vite optimizes and hashes images (better Compression + Caching).
		✅ Ensures images exist at compile time Webpack/Vite validation
